/* 
        Arduino Library for Honeywell MPR Pressure Sensors
        
        Supports connecting multiple Honeywell MPR sensors to the same Serial bus using SPI.

        Circuit:
        - Sensor SCL connected to scl0 of arduino (keep physically away from MISO and MOSI wires)
        - Sensor MOSI connected to MOSI0 pin of arduino
        - Sensor MISO connected to MISO0 pin of arduino
        - Sensor SS connected to any digital pin on arduino (for some microcontrollers you need to use a specific pin for at least one pin (e.g. pin 10))
        - VCC Connected to 3.3V logic
        - Ground to Ground
        - Any additional sensors can connect SCL, MOSI, MISO, VCC, and Ground in Parallel to the first sensor. SS pin has to be unique.
